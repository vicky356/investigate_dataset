This is the first project I worked on following my enrollent to the Udacitys
Data Analysis Nanodegree via ALX-T.
The emphasis of this project was more on identifying and working with dependent
and independent variables with a shallow exploration of the Data Analysis Process's.

The generated report is based on dataset from The Movie Database(TMDb) containing 10866 entries
where I analyzed the various features in the dataset that are associated with high revenue movies 
such as movie genre, popularity count, vote count, cast, directors and production companies.
